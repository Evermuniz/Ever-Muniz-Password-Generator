# Ever Muniz // Password Generator

## Description

I was provided with some beginning code to create a password generator. I had to write JavaScript code to get the desired outcome which taught me a lot about the structure and logic of JavaScript. I'm sure everyone's approach is a little different and I would welcome feedback on code I could've simplified. 

## Usage

- Click on "Generate Password" which will trigger a series of prompts
- First, input how many characters you would like your password to contain. The range is between 8 and 128.
- Second, follow the prompt to include upper case letters in your password or not
- Third, follow the prompt to include lower case letters in your password or not
- Fourth, follow the prompt to include numbers in your password or not
- Next, follow the prompt to include special characters in your password or not

If you didn't choose to include any characters in your passwor, then you will be prompted to try again. 

Your password will appear on the page. Copy the password or click "Generate Password" to start over!
